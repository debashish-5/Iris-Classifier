# Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a simple Machine Learning project using the popular Iris flower dataset. The objective of the project is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) using supervised learning algorithms.

## Repository Structure

M-L.ipynb         - Jupyter notebook with all ML code and analysis  
iris.xlsx         - Full dataset of iris flowers  
iris-train.xlsx   - Training dataset  
iris-test.xlsx    - Testing dataset  

## Project Highlights

- Dataset used: Iris Dataset  
- Algorithms: RandomforestClassifier
- Data split into training and testing files  

## Algorithms Applied

- RandomforestClassifier

## Features (Columns in Dataset)

- SepalLengthCm  
- SepalWidthCm  
- PetalLengthCm  
- PetalWidthCm  
- Species (Target Label)  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone [(https://github.com/debashish-5/Iris-Classifier)

2. Open M-L.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

3. Run the cells to understand the data, preprocessing, training, and predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x    
- scikit-learn  
- jupyter  

Install them using pip:
pip install scikit-learn jupyter

## Goals

- Understand classification models using a real-world dataset  
- Practice data preprocessing and model evaluation  
- Learn to split datasets into training and testing sets  

## Future Work

- Improve model accuracy using hyperparameter tuning  
- Add cross-validation  
- Use ensemble models like Random Forest or XGBoost  

## Contribution

This is a beginner-friendly project. Contributions and suggestions are welcome. Feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request.
